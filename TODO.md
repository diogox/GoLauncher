* When trying to focus an already open instance of `Display`, the launcher simply opens a new instance.
* Use `go build -ldflags="-s -w" main.go` to compile, for smaller binaries. (Read [this](https://blog.filippo.io/shrink-your-go-binaries-with-this-one-weird-trick/).)
* Improve error handling.
* Implement a cli to start the app and take in several config options.
